# password-generator
This is a simple and customizable password generator written in Python. It allows you to generate strong, random passwords with options to include letters, numbers, and symbols.

How to Run:
1. Clone the Repository:
   
  git clone https://github.com/erickim9/password-generator.git
  
  cd password-generator

2. Run the script:
   
  python password_generator_project.py
  
  OR
  
  python3 password_generator_project.py


  Why I made this:

  I built this project because I hate going to sketchy websites and asking them to generate a password. If they encounter a unlikely breach, the info might be used to link the password to me. Also, this project helped me practice Python and learn more about randomization.
